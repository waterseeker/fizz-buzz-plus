This is a project building on the fizzbuzz coding challenge. The intent is to create a UI where the user can input some values which will 
    be used to adjust the fizzbuzz function. 

    TODO:
    User inputs for
        Multiple(s) to return something aside from a number on (this can be N number of multiples with an associated return value)
            For each multiple, a string value that will be returned.
        Number of iterations of the function to run.
    
    A display component to show the multiples with the values that will be returned on that multiple. 
    A button to trigger the function. 
    A display component for showing the result of the funciton call.
